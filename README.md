# cell_nuclei

Due on May 16th

Todo:
Minimum for success in milestone:
Pre-Process Data: 
Copied code from online to overlay masks for one input image and one output image
Need to split data into training validation and test

Model:
Need to define IoU metric
Pytorch model for U-net: working on this, many things in keras makes this easier than in pytorch
Use Adam optimizer as first step

Next steps for milestone:
Transfer learning on ImagNet (need to figure out how to do transfer learning with U-net)
Figure out how to iterate on U-net implementation
